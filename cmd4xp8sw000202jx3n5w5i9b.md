In a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the path to creating reliable AI solutions that actually work in production isn’t just about using the latest models — it’s about implementing a structured development approach. In a comprehensive presentation, Anita, who leads Gen Growth and Education at Vum, shares invaluable insights on how companies can build effective agentic workflows using test-driven development principles.

### The Evolution of AI Development

The AI landscape has transformed dramatically since 2023. Remember when everyone was building simple AI wrappers with questionable defensibility? Fast forward to today, and we have companies like Cursor AI reaching $100 million ARR in just 12 months — the fastest-growing SaaS in history.

This meteoric rise isn’t just because models got better at coding or AI adoption skyrocketed. It’s because developers discovered new techniques and patterns for orchestrating AI models to work effectively in production environments.

Despite impressive advances, AI still faces significant challenges:

\- Hallucinations remain problematic

\- Overfitting continues to be an issue

\- Developers need more structured outputs

While model providers have improved their tooling, we haven’t seen leaps as dramatic as the jump from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4. The strategy of simply making models bigger and feeding them more data has begun to yield diminishing returns.

### New Training Methods Pushing Boundaries

However, recent months have seen exciting developments in training methodologies. DeepSeek R1 became the first model trained without labeled data using real reinforcement learning — reportedly similar to what OpenAI used for their reasoning models like o1 and o3.

These reasoning models employ Chain of Thought thinking at inference time, allowing them to “think” before answering and solve more complex reasoning problems. Meanwhile, model providers continue expanding capabilities with better tool use, research capabilities, and improved OCR accuracy.

Yet even with these advances, traditional benchmarks are so saturated that researchers are introducing new, more challenging ones like the “humanities last exam,” where even the latest models struggle significantly.

### Beyond Models: The Evolution of AI Workflows

As Anita points out, “For an AI product that actually works in production, success isn’t just about the models anymore — it’s about how you build around it.”

The field has evolved through several key techniques:

\- Chain of Thought prompting for better reasoning

\- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for grounding responses in proprietary data

\- Memory systems for multi-threaded conversations

\- Graph RAG for hierarchical responses

\- Reasoning models that take more time to “think” in real-time

\- Agentic RAG for more powerful self-operating workflows

But even with these techniques, success requires deeply understanding your problem and taking a test-driven development approach.

### Test-Driven Development for AI Products

The most successful AI teams follow a structured approach:

1\. Experiment

2\. Evaluate

3\. Scale

4\. Deploy in production

5\. Continuously monitor, observe, and improve

### Experimentation Phase

Before building anything production-grade, you need to prove AI models can solve your use case:

\- Try different prompting techniques (few-shot, Chain of Thought)

\- Test various techniques like prompt chaining

\- Explore agentic workflows like ReAct (Reason, Act, Reflect)

\- Involve domain experts (not just engineers)

\- Stay model-agnostic by testing different models for your specific use case

### Evaluation Phase

Once you’ve proven your concept works, you need to test if it will perform in production:

\- Create datasets with hundreds of examples

\- Balance quality, cost, latency, and privacy

\- Define priorities early in the process

\- Use ground-truth data where possible

\- Implement a flexible testing framework that can handle non-deterministic responses

\- Run evaluations at every stage with guardrails

### Production Deployment

When deploying to production, your work isn’t done:

\- Monitor more than just outputs — log all LLM calls, inputs, outputs, and latency

\- Handle API reliability with retries and fallback logic

\- Implement version control and staging environments

\- Decouple AI deployments from your regular app deployment schedule

\- Build a feedback loop to identify edge cases

\- Consider a caching layer to reduce costs and improve latency

\- Eventually, use production data to fine-tune custom models

### Understanding Agentic Workflows

Anita provides a helpful framework for understanding different levels of agentic behavior in AI systems:

\*\*Level 0:\*\* Basic LLM calls with vector database retrieval and inline evaluations. No external reasoning or planning.

\*\*Level 1:\*\* Systems that can use tools and decide when to call them. Memory plays a key role for multi-threaded conversations.

\*\*Level 2:\*\* Structured reasoning workflows that can notice triggers, plan actions, and execute tasks in sequence. These can break down complex tasks into steps.

\*\*Level 3:\*\* Autonomous systems that proactively take actions without direct input, continuously monitoring their environment and reacting as needed.

\*\*Level 4:\*\* Creative AI that can invent its own workflows, utilities, and tools, solving problems in novel ways — currently out of reach but the ultimate goal.

Most production-grade solutions today operate at Level 1, with significant innovation happening at Level 2. Levels 3 and 4 remain limited by current model capabilities.

### Real-World Application: An SEO Agent

To demonstrate these principles, Anita showcased an SEO agent that automates the entire process from keyword research to content creation:

1\. An SEO analyst analyzes top-performing articles for a given keyword

2\. A researcher identifies missing information and gathers additional data

3\. A writer creates a first draft using the gathered information

4\. An editor evaluates the draft against predefined criteria

5\. The writer revises based on feedback until quality criteria are met

This workflow, operating between Levels 1 and 2, demonstrates how agentic systems can automate complex tasks while maintaining quality through continuous evaluation.

### Conclusion: The Future of AI Development

As AI development continues to evolve, the focus is shifting from simply having the latest models to implementing structured development approaches that ensure reliability in production. Test-driven development provides a framework for building AI systems that not only work but continue to improve over time.

For those interested in building their own AI agents, Vum has introduced an open-source Workflow SDK that provides building blocks for customizable workflows with self-documenting syntax and seamless UI/code synchronization.
