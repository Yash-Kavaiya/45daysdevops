In the evolving landscape of AI application development, Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) stands out as a powerful framework for creating intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks. Among its many capabilities, the ability to build search-powered agents opens up remarkable possibilities for developers looking to create contextually aware applications. Today, I’ll walk you through the process of creating a search agent using ADK, exploring the tools, implementation details, and best practices along the way.

### The Power of ADK Tools: Beyond Basic LLM Interactions

Before diving into implementation, let’s understand what makes ADK such a compelling platform for agent development. At its core, ADK provides a flexible foundation for connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and data sources. This connection transforms passive language models into active agents capable of retrieving information, executing functions, and taking meaningful actions based on user requests.

ADK supports three primary types of tools:

1.  **Function Calling Tools** — Custom Python functions (99% of your tool usage)
2.  **Built-in Google Tools** — Pre-configured Google capabilities (search, code execution, RAG)
3.  **Third-party Tools** — Integration with frameworks like LangChain and Crew AI

For search agents specifically, the built-in Google Search tool provides immediate access to the web’s vast knowledge, while custom function tools let you refine and customize search behavior to your specific requirements.

### Creating Your First Search Agent: A Step-by-Step Guide

Let’s get practical and build a search agent that can find and summarize information from the web. Here’s the step-by-step process:

### 1\. Setting Up Your Project Structure

First, ensure you have ADK installed in your virtual environment:

pip install google-adk

Create a project folder structure that follows ADK conventions:

parent\_folder/      <-- navigate to this directory  
    basic\_search\_agent/  
        \_\_init\_\_.py  
        agent.py  
        .env

### 2\. Implementing the Search Agent

In your `agent.py` file, you'll define your agent with the Google Search tool:

from google.adk.agents import Agent  
from google.adk.runners import Runner  
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService  
from google.adk.tools import google\_search  
from google.genai import types  
  
APP\_NAME="google\_search\_agent"  
USER\_ID="user1234"  
SESSION\_ID="1234"  
  
  
root\_agent = Agent(  
    name="basic\_search\_agent",  
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",  
    description="Agent to answer questions using Google Search.",  
    instruction="I can answer your questions by searching the internet. Just ask me anything!",  
    \# google\_search is a pre-built tool which allows the agent to perform Google searches.  
    tools=\[google\_search\]  
)  
  
\# Session and Runner  
session\_service = InMemorySessionService()  
session = session\_service.create\_session(app\_name=APP\_NAME, user\_id=USER\_ID, session\_id=SESSION\_ID)  
runner = Runner(agent=root\_agent, app\_name=APP\_NAME, session\_service=session\_service)  
  
  
\# Agent Interaction  
def call\_agent(query):  
    """  
    Helper function to call the agent with a query.  
    """  
    content = types.Content(role='user', parts=\[types.Part(text=query)\])  
    events = runner.run(user\_id=USER\_ID, session\_id=SESSION\_ID, new\_message=content)  
  
    for event in events:  
        if event.is\_final\_response():  
            final\_response = event.content.parts\[0\].text  
            print("Agent Response: ", final\_response)  
  
call\_agent("what's the latest ai news?")

GOOGLE\_GENAI\_USE\_VERTEXAI=FALSE

GOOGLE\_API\_KEY="key"

from . import agent

This simple configuration creates a powerful agent that can now search the web and process the results. The magic happens in how ADK connects the Gemini model’s reasoning capabilities with Google’s search infrastructure.

### 3\. Enhancing Your Agent with Custom Tools

While the built-in search tool is powerful, you might want to extend your agent’s capabilities with custom functions. Here’s how you can add a time function alongside search:

### Best Practices for Building Effective Search Agents

From the ADK documentation and experience, here are critical best practices to follow:

1.  **Be Specific with Return Values** When creating custom tools, always return dictionaries with descriptive keys. Instead of returning raw results, structure them with clear labels
2.  **Clear Docstrings are Essential** The agent determines when to call a function based on its docstring, so make them clear and comprehensive.
3.  **Type Annotations Matter** Always specify parameter types to help the agent understand what inputs are expected.
4.  **Avoid Default Parameters** As mentioned in the documentation, default parameters don’t work in ADK (at least in the current version), so explicitly define all required parameters.
5.  **Be Aware of Tool Combination Limitations** Currently, ADK has some limitations when combining tool types:

*   You can only use one built-in tool at a time
*   You can’t mix built-in tools with custom function tools
*   You can use multiple custom function tools together

### Running and Testing Your Search Agent

To run your search agent, you can use the ADK web interface for testing:

\# Navigate to your agent directory  
cd search\_agent

\# Activate your virtual environment (if using one)  
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac  
\# or  
venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows

\# Start the ADK web interface  
adk web

This will launch a local web server where you can interact with your agent through a user-friendly interface. Try prompts like:

*   “What are the latest AI announcements from Google I/O?”
*   “Find information about renewable energy trends in 2025”
*   “Search for recent breakthroughs in quantum computing”

### Real-World Applications of Search Agents

The applications for search-powered agents extend far beyond simple information retrieval:

1.  **Research Assistants** that gather, summarize, and analyze information from multiple sources
2.  **Knowledge Bases** that stay automatically updated with the latest information
3.  **Customer Support Systems** that can pull relevant product information and troubleshooting steps
4.  **Market Intelligence Tools** that monitor competitors and industry trends

### Looking Beyond: Advanced Search Capabilities

As ADK evolves, we’ll likely see more sophisticated search capabilities:

1.  **Multi-source Search** combining web results with internal documents
2.  **Personalized Search** that learns user preferences over time
3.  **Agent Collaboration** where multiple specialized agents work together to refine search results

### Limitations to Be Aware Of

While powerful, there are some current limitations to consider:

1.  Built-in tools only work with Gemini models, not with OpenAI or Claude models
2.  You cannot combine built-in tools with custom tools in the same agent
3.  You can only use one built-in tool at a time

### Conclusion: The Future of Agent-Powered Search

Search agents represent just the beginning of what’s possible with ADK. As tools become more sophisticated and the boundaries between different AI systems continue to blur, we’ll see increasingly powerful agents that not only find information but understand, analyze, and act upon it in contextually appropriate ways.

Building a search agent with ADK today puts you at the forefront of this exciting frontier. The combination of powerful LLMs with the web’s vast information creates assistants that can truly augment human intelligence and productivity in meaningful ways.
