One of the simplest yet effective ways to make a chatbot feel more personal is by tailoring its greeting to the user’s time of day. Dialogflow CX offers powerful tools that allow us to set up these time-sensitive greetings, enabling the chatbot to say “Good morning,” “Good afternoon,” or “Good evening,” based on when the user initiates the conversation. This guide will walk you through creating these dynamic greetings in Dialogflow CX.

#### Why Time-Based Greetings Matter

Imagine you log onto a service early in the morning, and the chatbot greets you with, “Good morning! How can I assist you today?” This small touch not only makes the interaction feel more human but also shows that the chatbot is tuned to your needs. Time-sensitive greetings create a welcoming, engaging experience and make users more comfortable interacting with the bot

### Setting Up Your Agent

Before implementing time-based greetings, ensure you have a Dialogflow CX agent set up:

1.  Open the Dialogflow CX console
2.  Create a new agent or select an existing one
3.  Navigate to the Default Start Flow

Add response in Conditional Response
