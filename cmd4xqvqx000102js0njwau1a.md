### The Exponential Rise of AI

The past few years have witnessed unprecedented growth in AI capabilities. Since the release of Stable Diffusion in August 2022, we’ve seen a hockey stick curve of innovation. The last 18 months have been particularly explosive, with models becoming more performant and compute-efficient across a broadening landscape of providers beyond just OpenAI and Anthropic — including xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, and numerous others.

2025 has accelerated this trajectory with several landmark developments:

*   The $500 billion Stargate project collaboration between the US government, OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle
*   OpenAI’s O3 model exceeding human performance on the ARC AGI challenge
*   DeepSeek’s R1 model launch creating significant market impact
*   France’s new AI initiative aiming to put Europe “back in the game”

### The Perfect Storm for AI Agents

Grace characterized 2025 as “the perfect storm” for AI agents, driven by several converging factors:

*   **Reasoning models** from OpenAI (O1, O3), DeepSeek (R1), and Grock are outperforming human abilities in many domains
*   **Test-time compute** is increasing model performance at inference rather than training
*   **Engineering optimizations** are driving efficiency gains
*   **Inference costs** continue to decrease
*   The **open source/closed source gap** is narrowing
*   **Massive infrastructure investments** from governments and corporations worldwide

### When Lightning Doesn’t Strike: The Reality Check

Despite this promising environment, Grace offered a sobering reality check: AI agents aren’t quite working yet. Using the seemingly simple example of booking a flight with specific parameters through OpenAI’s Operator, she demonstrated how even straightforward tasks can fail.

The problem isn’t just about hallucinations or fabrications — it’s about the accumulation of small errors that compound in complex systems:

1.  **Decision errors**: Choosing the wrong facts (booking a flight to San Francisco, Peru instead of California)
2.  **Implementation errors**: Wrong access or integration issues (getting locked out of critical databases)
3.  **Heuristic errors**: Using incorrect criteria (not allowing enough time for traffic to JFK airport)
4.  **Taste errors**: Missing personal preferences (booking a Boeing 737 Max for someone afraid of flying on that aircraft)
5.  **Perfection Paradox**: Magical capabilities triggering unrealistic expectations

### The Compounding Problem

Grace illustrated how these errors compound in complex systems. Two simple agents — one with 99% accuracy and another with 95% accuracy — show a startling 50% performance difference after just 50 consecutive steps. The 99% agent drops to 60% reliability in that scenario, highlighting how even minor errors amplify significantly in multi-agent, multi-step tasks.

### Five Strategies for Building Better AI Agents

Despite these challenges, Grace outlined five practical strategies to mitigate cumulative errors and build more effective AI agents:

### 1\. Data Curation: The Foundation of Agent Intelligence

Modern AI agents must handle increasingly diverse data types — not just text and web data, but images, video, audio, sensor data, and even the data generated by the agents themselves. Effective agents require:

*   Curated proprietary data
*   Quality control processes
*   Dynamic data flywheels where each user interaction improves the system

As Grace noted, “Data is your best asset, and curation is key to making it more effective.”

### 2\. Robust Evaluation Frameworks

Measuring an AI agent’s performance isn’t straightforward, especially in non-verifiable domains. While math and science tasks have clear right or wrong answers, many real-world problems don’t.

The challenge becomes: How do we collect signals about what users actually want? Sometimes, the most effective evaluation is simply trying the agent yourself and assessing its performance based on your specific needs — no leaderboard required.

### 3\. Scaffolding Systems to Prevent Cascading Failures

When one part of an agent fails, robust systems ensure the entire operation doesn’t collapse. Grace highlighted Ramp’s approach: when a new AI feature fails, infrastructure logic prevents cascading effects across their entire system.

As models become more sophisticated, scaffolding must evolve to support self-healing agents that can recognize their own errors and correct course autonomously.

### 4\. User Experience as the Ultimate Differentiator

With foundation models rapidly commoditizing, UX becomes the critical differentiator. The most successful AI applications deeply understand user workflows and create seamless human-machine collaboration:

*   Asking clarifying questions to fully understand user intent
*   Anticipating the user’s next steps
*   Integrating smoothly with existing systems

Grace emphasized that AI companies with proprietary data sources and deep workflow knowledge in specialized domains (robotics, defense, life sciences) are particularly well-positioned to create transformative experiences.

### 5\. Building Multimodally for Richer Interactions

Grace expressed fatigue with the ubiquitous chatbot interface, arguing for multimodal approaches that make AI more human-like:

*   Incorporating voice, vision, and other sensory inputs
*   Developing AI with “memory” that truly knows users personally
*   Creating embodied experiences through robotics

“Even if that agent is inconsistent or unreliable,” Grace noted, “the visionary nature of the product exceeds all expectations.”

### Looking Forward

While we may be in the perfect storm for AI agents, Grace concluded that “the lightning hasn’t struck yet.” AI agents won’t emerge overnight — they’ll require diligent work to overcome the challenges of cumulative errors.

By focusing on data curation, robust evaluations, error-resistant scaffolding, exceptional UX, and multimodal interactions, developers can push the boundaries of what’s possible. The most successful AI agents won’t just be technically impressive; they’ll reimagine how humans and machines can collaborate to solve complex problems.

As we navigate this frontier, the organizations that think beyond technical capabilities to create truly transformative user experiences will lead the next wave of AI innovation.
