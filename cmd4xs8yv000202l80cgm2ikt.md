In the evolving landscape of conversational AI, Google’s Dialogflow CX has emerged as a powerful platform for building sophisticated virtual agents. At the heart of these conversational experiences lies the concept of intentsthe mechanism through which a chatbot understands what users are trying to communicate

Dialogflow CX Intents

### What Are Intents, Really?

Intents in Dialogflow CX represent the underlying purpose behind a user’s message. Think of them as the “why” behind what users say, not just the words themselves.

When a user types “I need to change my flight,” the literal words matter less than their intention: they want to modify an existing booking. This distinction is crucial because users can express the same intent in countless ways:

*   “Can I switch my departure time?”
*   “Need to reschedule my flight”
*   “Different flight please”
